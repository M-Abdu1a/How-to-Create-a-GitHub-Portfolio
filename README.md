# 📚 How to Create a GitHub Portfolio

Hi, I'm Muhammad Abdullah! 👋🏻 This is a **fuss-free** guide to create your GitHub portfolio. 

It's perfect for:
- Beginners in data science looking to showcase samples of work or projects.
- Serves as a digital resume to demonstrate your technical skills. 
- A fun way to track your projects.

**Why I created this repo?**
- I used to find GitHub intimidating. When I first signed up, I didn't understand how it worked and ended up leaving it aside. 
- Since then, I've become quite obsessed with writing in Markdown 😆 and have learned how to use it. Now, I'm excited to share this knowledge with everyone. 🙂

## Introduction 

Let's start by understanding some of the terms you'll come across on GitHub:

📌 `Repository` (or `repo`) means `folder`. Each repository represents a folder on your computer. You can create multiple repositories for different projects. 

📌 `README.md` is a default note or summary that's usually included in each repo. It acts as the "homepage" of your repo where you can introduce the project, provide a summary, or anything else.  

📌 `Fork` means `copy + paste` in layman's terms. Let's say you want to make a copy of this guide, have access to it, and edit it. Any changes you make in your copy won't affect the original guide.

You don't need GitHub Desktop to set up your portfolio. Your browser will do the job just fine. 🙂

## How to Create Your Profile on GitHub?

Interested in creating a personalized profile that appears on your GitHub homepage? Follow these simple steps:

**Step 1:** Click on `+` sign and select `New Repository` at the top right corner of the page.

**Step 2:** Create a new repository with the _exact same name as your username_.  

For example, my GitHub username is "**M-Abdu1a**", so I created a repository named "**M-Abdu1a**". This will contain the write-up of your profile.

The file format for the profile is `Markdown (.md)`. By default, the file is named `README.md`, so you can leave it as is.

**Step 3:** To edit your Profile or Markdown file, click on the pencil `✏️` icon on your right and select `Edit this file`.

Now, start writing your profile! 😄 Once you're done, scroll down and click `Commit changes`.
